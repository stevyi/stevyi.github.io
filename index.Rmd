## Course Project : Lession 7 - Regression Models

### Regression Models Course Project  

- URL: *http://rpubs.com/stevyip/76509*

- The purpose of this presentation is to showcase the use of Shiny and Slidify for data analysis using R programming (e.g., R Studio tool). It is a simple and powerful tool to present data, analyse and predict possible outcomes, in a web-based interactive environment.

- These application tools are capable to present how simple it is to do a quick exploratory analysis, using an interactive graph plotting (e.g.,boxplot) for users to study the relationship of different variables on mpg.

## Source Data

> The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, comprises fuel consumption with respect to 10 aspects of design and performance for 32 cars (1973â€“74 models) to study and explore the relationship between a set of variables and MPG.

## Description of "mtcars" dataset 

** A data frame with 32 observations on 11 variables.**

| Index | Field | Detail |
------- | ----- | ------ |
| [, 1] | mpg   | Miles/(US) gallon |
| [, 2] | cyl   | Number of cylinders |
| [, 3]	| disp  | Displacement (cu.in.) |
| [, 4]	| hp    | Gross horsepower |
| [, 5]	| drat  | Rear axle ratio |
| [, 6]	| wt    | Weight (lb/1000) |
| [, 7]	| qsec  | 1/4 mile time |
| [, 8]	| vs    | V/S |
| [, 9]	| am    | Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual) |
| [,10]	| gear  | Number of forward gears |
| [,11]	| carb  | Number of carburetors |

## Conclusion

- In the Regression Models project, we concluded that manual transmission automobiles provide higher values of MPG and there is a correlation between "mpg" with variables such as "cyl", "disp", "hp", "drat","wt", "qsec","vs", "am", "gear" and "carb". 

- In summary, a series of modeling have been conducted with the following conclusions:

  * Automobiles with manual transmissions have better MPG than automatic transmisions by 1.8 and it is affected by horsepower, number of cylinders and weight of the automobile.
  * MPG decreases by only 0.32 for every increase of 10hp horsepower.
  * MPG decreases by 3.0 or 2.2 if the number of cylinders increases from 4 to 6 or 8.
  * MPG decreases with weight of the automobiles, e.g., about 2.5 for every 1000lb increase.
